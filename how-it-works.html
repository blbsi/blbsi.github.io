				<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>
The software is written in python. It is a framework to implement simple tests that can be run via SSH on remote machines.
It runs through releavant installed software components and checks their configuration for best practices and security policies. It implements best practices known from CIS (center for internet security), OWASP, BSI and other well known authorities in IT security.

From the result it calculates a score for each host which is a relative measure for the security level of that host. It also prints out findings that should be fixed. On an Apache HTTP Server this could for example be a strict warning that WebDAV is enabled or that the apache server is configured to use weak SSL ciphers.

<br/>
It runs in the following steps:
<br/>

<ul>
<li>central server gets check modules from repository</li>
<li>central server logs into target machines via SSH key</li>
<li>check module is executed and does inventory (is it a webserver, is it a DB?)</li>
<li>depending on the installed software it runs check modules (it is not running a DB check on a Webserver)</li>
<li>it reports the results to a WebGUI that displays a score and a history for each host</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
